# Command Reference

## Unified Entry Point

### `/work [input]`

Auto-classifies your task and routes to the appropriate workflow. Accepts:

- **No arguments**: Extracts the task from your current conversation context
- Task description: `/work "Add user profile page"`
- Task folder path: `/work .owflow/tasks/new-features/2026-02-17-user-profile` (resumes)
- GitHub issue URL: `/work https://github.com/org/repo/issues/42`

The plugin classifies the task type with confidence scoring, asks for confirmation, then launches the matching orchestrator.

## Development

### `/development [description | task-path]`

Starts the unified development workflow (14 adaptive phases) or resumes an existing one. All arguments are optional — when run without a description, the plugin extracts it from your current conversation. Pass an existing task path to resume. Task type (bug/enhancement/feature) is auto-detected from context when `--type` is omitted.

| Flag                               | Description                                             |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--type=bug\|enhancement\|feature` | Specify task type (auto-detected if omitted)            |
| `--e2e`                            | Include E2E testing phase                               |
| `--user-docs`                      | Generate user documentation phase                       |
| `--code-review`                    | Include code review phase                               |
| `--research=PATH`                  | Start development informed by a completed research task |
| `--from=PHASE`                     | Start from or resume at a specific phase                |
| `--reset-attempts`                 | Reset failed attempt counters (resume)                  |

**Task directory**: `.owflow/tasks/development/`
**Resume phases**: `analysis`, `gap`, `spec`, `plan`, `implement`, `verify`

## Performance

### `/performance [description | task-path]`

Starts performance optimization with static bottleneck analysis (9 phases) or resumes an existing one. Can be run without arguments — the plugin extracts the optimization target from your conversation. Detects N+1 queries, missing indexes, O(n^2) algorithms, blocking I/O, and memory leak patterns.

| Flag               | Description                              |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| `--from=PHASE`     | Start from or resume at a specific phase |
| `--reset-attempts` | Reset failed attempt counters (resume)   |

You can optionally provide profiling data (flame graphs, APM screenshots) — the workflow creates a directory for these.

**Task directory**: `.owflow/tasks/performance/`
**Resume phases**: `analysis`, `specification`, `planning`, `implementation`, `verification`

---

## Migration

### `/migration [description | task-path]`

Starts migration workflow (8 phases) with mandatory rollback planning and risk assessment, or resumes an existing one. Can be run without arguments — the plugin extracts migration details from your conversation.

| Flag                                       | Description                              |
| ------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| `--type=code\|data\|architecture\|general` | Migration type (affects risk focus)      |
| `--from=PHASE`                             | Start from or resume at a specific phase |

## Reviews & Audits

Standalone review commands that can be run anytime, independent of workflows.

### `/reviews-code [path]`

Automated code quality, security, and performance analysis.

| Flag                                          | Description                 |
| --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `--scope=quality\|security\|performance\|all` | Focus area (default: `all`) |

Analyzes complexity, duplication, code smells, security vulnerabilities, and performance issues. Generates report with severity levels (Critical/Warning/Info).

### `/reviews-pragmatic [path]`

Detects over-engineering and ensures code matches project scale. Identifies excessive abstraction, enterprise patterns in simple code, infrastructure overkill. Recommends specific simplifications with before/after examples.

### `/reviews-reality-check [task-path]`

Validates that completed work actually solves the intended problem. Runs tests, checks end-to-end workflows, and evaluates error scenarios. Returns deployment decision: Ready / Issues Found / Not Ready.

### `/reviews-spec-audit [spec-path]`

Independent specification audit with senior auditor perspective.

| Flag                    | Description                                                         |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--post-implementation` | Compare spec vs actual implementation (default: pre-implementation) |

Identifies ambiguities, missing details, and gaps. Uses external tools (GitHub CLI, Azure CLI) for verification.

### `/reviews-production-readiness [path]`

| Flag                     | Description                                          |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `--target=prod\|staging` | Target environment (default: `prod` with full rigor) |

---

## Standards

### `/flow-init [--standards-from=PATH]`

Initialize the Owflow framework. Scans your codebase with a project-analyzer subagent, presents findings for confirmation, then generates:

- `.owflow/docs/` with INDEX.md, project docs (vision, roadmap, tech-stack), and coding standards
- `.owflow/tasks/` directory structure
- AGENTS.md integration

| Flag                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--standards-from=PATH` | Copy standards from another project's `.owflow/docs/standards/` instead of built-in defaults. Useful when starting a new project that should follow the same conventions as an existing one. |

If `.owflow/` already exists, offers to backup, update, or cancel.

### `/standards-discover [--scope=SCOPE]`

Auto-discovers coding standards from multiple sources in parallel: config files, source code patterns, documentation, pull requests, and CI/CD pipelines.

| Flag                                                      | Description                                         |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `--scope=full\|quick\|frontend\|backend\|testing\|custom` | Discovery scope (default: `full`)                   |
| `--confidence=N`                                          | Minimum confidence threshold, 0-100 (default: `60`) |
| `--auto-apply`                                            | Auto-apply standards with 90%+ confidence           |
| `--skip-external`                                         | Skip PR and CI/CD analysis                          |
| `--pr-count=N`                                            | Number of PRs to analyze (default: `10`, max: `20`) |

Presents findings in confidence tiers (high/medium/low) for review before applying.

### `/standards-update [description] [--from=PATH]`

Update or create standards from conversation context or explicit description. When run without arguments, scans your current conversation for standards patterns like "we should always...", "our convention is...", "prefer X over Y" and proposes them as new standards.

| Flag          | Description                                                                                                                                |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `--from=PATH` | Sync standards from another project. Analyzes differences, shows what's missing or changed, and lets you select which standards to import. |

## Quick Commands

Lightweight commands for small tasks that don't need a full orchestrator workflow.

### `/quick-dev [task description]`

Implement a task directly with standards awareness. Reads INDEX.md, loads applicable standards, then implements without planning mode.

**When to use**: Task is clear, no architectural decisions needed, you know what needs doing.

### `/quick-plan [task description]`

Enter OpenCode's planning mode with standards awareness. Discovers and reads applicable standards _before_ entering plan mode, so your plan is informed by project conventions.

Standards compliance checklist is required in the plan file before exiting plan mode.

### `/quick-bugfix [bug description]`

Lightweight TDD-driven bug fix without a full orchestrator workflow. Analyzes the bug, writes a failing test, implements the fix, and verifies the test passes.

**When to use**: Simple, isolated bugs where you can quickly identify the root cause. If the bug is too complex (multiple files, unclear root cause, architectural impact), the skill suggests escalating to `/development`.

No task directory created — works directly in your codebase.
